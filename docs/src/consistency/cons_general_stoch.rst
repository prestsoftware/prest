Stochastic Consistency Criteria for General Datasets
====================================================

For datasets where the same menus appear more than once, 
Prest can compute, view and export the total number of violations 
of each of the axioms/criteria of stochastic choice consistency listed below,
for every subject in the dataset.

.. tip::
     **To use the stochastic-consistency feature:** right-click on the dataset of interest [e.g. "DatasetX.csv"] in the workspace and select *"Analysis -> Stochastic consistency analysis"*.

     **To view the stochastic-consistency output:** right-click on the Prest-generated dataset ["DatasetX.csv (stochastic consistency)"] in the workspace and then click on "View".

     **To export the stochastic-consistency output (in .xslx or .csv format):** right-click on the Prest-generated dataset ["DatasetX.csv (stochastic consistency)"] 
     in the workspace, and click on "Export" and "Summary...".
