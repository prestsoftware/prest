Workspace area
--------------

|

Prest's **workspace** is the area where all datasets (either imported from file or Prest-generated) 
are available for analysis and/or exporting.

|

The three columns in the workspace area provide the following information about all datasets listed there:

**Name**. The name of the dataset, as imported from file or specified by the user through a Prest operation.
   
**Alternatives/Goods**. Depending on whether the dataset in question is :ref:`general <general-datasets>` 
or :ref:`budgetary <budgetary-datasets>`, the total number of alternatives or goods in that dataset is shown, respectively.
   
**Size**. The total number of subjects and observations in the dataset.

|

Right-clicking on a dataset in the workspace area leads to the following options:
 
 
**View**. Displays the contents of the dataset in a separate window (this is also done by double-clicking on the dataset).
   
**Analysis**. The available options here depend on whether the selected dataset is :ref:`general <general-datasets>` 
or :ref:`budgetary <budgetary-datasets>`.

|

**General datasets**

*Integrity check*. This option checks whether:

(i) the specified choices in the dataset are indeed elements of the corresponding menus of alternatives; 

(ii) any menus are repeated more than once for a given subject in the dataset.

A detailed report/dataset is produced if either of the above is true.

*Summary information*: This option generates a new dataset that gives the following counts per subject: 

(1) *Observations*.

(2) *Active choices* (number of times where the outside option -if feasible-  was *not* chosen).

(3) *Deferrals* (number of times where the outside option *was* chosen).

The dataset that results from this operation is named after the original dataset following insertion of the "(info)" suffix. 
For example, applying this operation on *"DatasetX"* generates *"DatasetX (info)"*, while the original dataset *"DatasetX"* is also kept in the workspace.
			   
*Consistency analysis*: details :ref:`here <general-consistency-tip>`. 

*Inconsistent tuples of menus*: details :ref:`here <menu-tuples>`. 
		
*Inconsistent tuples of alternatives*: details :ref:`here <alternative-tuples>`.

*Model estimation*: details :ref:`here <estimation>`.

*Merge choices at the same menu*: details :ref:`here <merging-tip>`.  

*Generate similar random dataset*: details :ref:`here <similar-random-dataset>`.
       	 
					 
**Budgetary datasets** 


*Consistency analysis*: details :ref:`here <budgetary-consistency-tip>`.

*Export*: this allows for exporting the selected dataset in .xlsx or .csv format. 

Special remarks for this option:

Dataset derived from *Model estimation* (more details :ref:`here <estimation>`):

(1) *Compact (human-friendly)*. Leaves the subject column blank in all but the first row 
    whenever there are multiple compatible models for a given subject.
		 
(2) *Detailed (machine-friendly)*. Includes subject information in every row.

Dataset derived from *Consistency analysis* (more details :ref:`here <general-consistency-tip>`):

(1) *Summary*.

(2) *WARP violations*.
		  
(3) *Congruence violations (wide)*.
		   
(4) *Strict general cycles (wide)*.
		   
(5) *Strict binary cycles (wide)*.
		   
(6) *Binary cycles (wide)*.
	
|

*Delete*. Removes the selected dataset from the workspace area.

Drop-down menu options
----------------------

**Workspace**:

(1) *Clear*. Removes all datasets from the workspace area.
	  
(2) *Restore from file*. Opens an existing Prest workspace file (.pwf) from the relevant directory.
	  
(3) *Save*. Saves the active Prest workspace file in the current location.
	  
(4) *Save as*. Allows to choose the location where the active Prest workspace file will be saved.
	  
(5) *Import general dataset*. Details :ref:`here <general-datasets>`.
	  
(6) *Import budgetary dataset*. Details :ref:`here <budgetary-datasets>`.
	  
(7) *Quit*. Exits the application.

**Simulation**:  Details :ref:`here <direct-simulations>`.
  
**Help**:

(1) *Prest manual*. Opens the embedded documentation page on the user's web browser.

(2) *About*. Opens a dialog with information about Prest's version, copyright and license.
